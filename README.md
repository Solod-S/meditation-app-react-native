**Main Technologies:**

- React Native: React Native is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write native apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase, offering seamless performance and a consistent user experience.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing developers with enhanced tooling and error checking. Designed for building large-scale applications, it helps catch potential issues early through type annotations, making code more robust and maintainable. TypeScript seamlessly integrates with JavaScript, enabling incremental adoption while improving developer productivity and collaboration.

- Expo: Expo is a powerful framework and platform for building React Native applications. It provides a set of tools and services to simplify development, such as managed workflows, over-the-air updates, and easy access to native APIs without requiring native code.

- NativeWind: NativeWind brings the power of Tailwind CSS to React Native. It enables developers to style mobile applications using utility-first class names, making it easy to build responsive and maintainable designs without custom CSS.

- React Native Vector Icons: React Native Vector Icons is a library that provides a wide selection of customizable vector icons for React Native applications. It supports various icon packs and allows developers to easily add scalable and visually appealing icons to their projects.
